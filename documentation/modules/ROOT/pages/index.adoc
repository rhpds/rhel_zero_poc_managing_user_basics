= Creating user accounts with useradd

Add a new account called *guest* using the `+useradd+` command:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
useradd guest
----

Confirm the account creation by examining the *passwd* file.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
grep -w guest /etc/passwd
----

Next, a password needs to be added to the user account to enable login.
