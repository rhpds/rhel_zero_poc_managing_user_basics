= Removing a user for a group

If you want to remove a user from a group without deleting the group,
run the following command:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
gpasswd -d guest viewers
----

____
_NOTE:_ This change will not take effect until the user logs in again.

== Deleting a group

If instead you want to delete the group all together, run the
`+groupdel+` command as root.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
groupdel viewers
----

If you are trying to remove the primary group of a user, you must remove
that user first.

Attempting to add a user to this group will print an error message
showing that it now does not exist.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
usermod -aG viewers guest
----
